Hey, that's an impressive start.

We aren't getting highlighting in the grid, but it seems to copy anyway.

This query on TestLangProj will show a bunch of Unicode in the output that
looks nice.

declare @own int
select @own=owner$ from StTxtPara_ where contents like '%French IPA%'
select contents from StTxtPara_ where owner$ = @own

It appears that I can't do anything that modifies the database. It always
gives "Attempted to divide by zero."


update StStyle set UserLevel = 1 where id=6647  ===> fails

update sttxtpara set contents = N'把草药敷在痛处。 一种舞' where id = 6857
===> fails

Gotta run, but it's a good start.

Don't worry about changing the order in the database combo. We can probably
live with it showing up the first one, alphabetically. It shouldn't show
master, though by default. That's too dangerous.

Love, Dad



WINDOWS APPLICATION (dbwin.exe)

This program provides basic functions similar to Query Analyzer. Input and
output should all be in Unicode. The minimum menus I'd recommend are:

File...Connect
File...Disconnect
File...New
File...Open
File...Save
File...Save As
File...Print (nice but could be added later)
File...Exit

Edit...Undo
Edit...Cut
Edit...Copy
Edit...Paste
Edit...Select All
Edit...Find (nice but could be added later)
Edit...Find Next (nice but could be added later)
Edit...Go to Line (nice but could wait)

Query...Execute
Query...Stop Execution
Query...Results in Text
Query...Results in Table
Query...Results to File...  (this should allow output to tab delimited text,
or CSV format, and ANSI or UTF-8).

Window...Cascade (nice but could be added later)
Window...Tile Horizontally (nice but could be added later)
Window...Tile Vertically (nice but could be added later)

Help...About

It would be nice to have the MDI window with different windows for each
connection, as in QA. The adjustable split pane is also very helpful.

It would be nice if the status bar could show the current server and
database name for this window, the line and column number (if not too hard),
and the total rows returned from the query.

It would be nice for the toolbar to have File and Edit buttons similar to QA
that are limited to our menu items. It should also have an Execute and Stop
execution button, and a combo to allow choosing a database. In the combo, we
should show FieldWorks databases first in alphabetical order, a dotted line,
and then the system databases in alphabetical order. The default on program
startup would be the first FieldWorks database.

If any of the above is especially complex, let me know and we'll rethink the
specifications.
