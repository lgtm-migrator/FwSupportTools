This folder contains the source and project files for the AutoSurveyor service. Before compiling, make sure you enter the password in the call to CreateService(), in file ServiceWrapper.cpp. More details in that file's first comment.

DO NOT CHECK IN THE FILE ServiceWrapper.cpp WITH THE PASSWORD STILL IN IT!
