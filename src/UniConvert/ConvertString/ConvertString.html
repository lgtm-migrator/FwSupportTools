<h2>1. Background</h2>

<p>In SIL we have language data encoded in dozens of non-standard
encodings. Historically, this resulted from linguists needing
special characters that were not part of any standard code page
to which they had ready access. The solution was to modify an
existing font, or build an entirely new font with the desired
glyphs. In some cases a glyph was a composite base character with
diacritic(s) and in other cases the diacritics were keyed as
separate code points and they were combined by the rendering
engine. This was our special character solution for both DOS and
Windows environments.</p>

<p>Our current goal is to move all of this data to Unicode,
including the Private Use Area, and possibly surrogates. During
the transition period, it is likely that users will need to
convert data in both directions between their custom 8-bit
encodings and Unicode encoded as UTF-8 or UTF-16. Note that
Unicode can also have multiple code points per character since
base characters and diacritics may be separate code points, and
surrogate values are also pairs of code points. It's likely that
we will also need to convert Unicode values to other Unicode
values to clean up data problems.</p>

<p>Language data may be contained in many kinds of documents. It
may be included in XML files, standard format files, LinguaLinks,
or FieldWorks databases, to name the most common examples.
Different languages use different encodings, so must be treated
separately by the conversion process. Files usually contain data
in multiple languages plus markup. Higher-level parsing to
extract language-specific strings from markup are left to other
processes. Also, conversion from 8-bit or UTF-8 to 16-bit values
and vice versa is left to other processes.</p>

<p>???????? ICsConvertXToX interfaces are low-level string
conversion COM interfaces designed to modify 16-bit strings in a
single encoding. They can be used by any program to change
strings to different encodings, or simply modify the code points
in a single encoding. The conversion process is accomplished by a
change engine that implements this interface. CsConvertXToX
classes implement the ICsConvertXToX interfaces and include a
built-in engine that uses a simple table lookup. Where more power
is needed, additional change engines can be written to use this
interface and provide more power. Each change engine uses its own
table format. Potential change engines implementing this
interface are CC and Perl.</p>

<p>There are three interfaces used for converting strings:
ICsConvertAToW, ICsConvertWToA, and ICsConvertWToW. The A in
these names stands for 8-bit strings, and the W stands for 16-bit
strings. Methods in these interfaces take another interface (ICsCallbackAToW,
ICsCallbackWToA, or ICsCallbackWToW) for callback messages
regarding initialization and processing failures.</p>

<p>ICsConvertXToX is used as follows: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Get an appropriate ICsConvertXToX (ICsConvertAToW,
		ICsConvertWToA, or ICsConvertWToW) interface via
		CoCreateInstance for the engine you want to use. The
		ProgIDs for the simple table lookup implementation of
		these interfaces are SIL.CS.ConvertAToW, SIL.CS.ConvertWToA,
		and SIL.CS.ConvertWToW.</li>
	<li>Initialize the engine with an appropriate table.</li>
	<li>Call the instance repeatedly to change strings of text.</li>
	<li>Release the instance </li>
</ol>

<p>Here are some possible applications for ICsConvertXToX:</p>

<ul>
	<li>applications converting to and from Unicode while
		importing or exporting (Shoebox, LinguaLinks, etc.)</li>
	<li>UniConvert program for converting a FieldWorks XML file
		to/from Unicode</li>
	<li>a program to convert standard format files to/from
		Unicode or other encodings</li>
	<li>an application that changes spelling</li>
	<li>an application that changes orthographies</li>
	<li>a transducer to create a new encoding</li>
</ul>

<p>The power available in the conversion is dependent on the
engine and its associated table.</p>

<h2>ICsConvertAToW interface</h2>

<p><strong>HRESULT Initialize([in] BSTR bstrTable, [in] BOOL
fFileName, [in] ICsCallbackAToW * pccaw)</strong></p>

<p>This method compiles a table and holds it in memory until
ICsConvertAToW is released.</p>

<p><em>bstrTable</em> is the path name for a file containing the
table, or the actual table, depending on fFileName. This cannot
be NULL.</p>

<p><em>fFileName</em> is true if bstrTable contains a file path
name and false if it contains the actual table text.</p>

<p><em>pccaw</em> is used to trap and respond to initialization
errors. This can be NULL if extended error information is not
needed. If this is not NULL and there is an error while
initializing the table, the ICsCallbackAToW::InitError method is
called with information about the error. If this is NULL and
there is an error while initializing the table, Initialize will
return a failure code.</p>

<p><strong>HRESULT Convert([in] CHAR * prgchSrc, [in] int cchSrc,
[out, retval] BSTR* pbstrDst)</strong></p>

<p>This method converts the input string to the output string
using the compiled table. It is assumed that each string is in a
single encoding and is complete. In other words, context is not
maintained between calls to Convert and the associated table is
reinitialized for each string. A string could be an entire file
if it were all in one encoding. The returned BSTR is a newly
allocated BSTR that the caller is responsible to free.</p>

<p><em>prgchSrc</em> is an 8-bit string containing the text to be
changed. This cannot be NULL.</p>

<p><em>cchSrc</em> gives the number of characters in prgchSrc.</p>

<p><em>pbstrDst</em> is a pointer to a BSTR containing the
changed text. This is a newly allocated BSTR that the caller is
responsible to free. This cannot be NULL.</p>

<p><strong>HRESULT ConvertRgch([in] CHAR * prgchSrc, [in] int
cchSrc, [out] OLECHAR * prgchDst, [in] int cchDst, [in]
ICsCallbackAToW * pccaw, [out, retval] int * pcchNeed)</strong></p>

<p>ConvertRgch is similar to Convert, but is optimized for C++
access.</p>

<p><em>prgchSrc</em> is a buffer of CHARs containing the 8-bit
input string to change. This cannot be NULL.</p>

<p><em>cchSrc</em> is the number of characters in prgchSrc.</p>

<p><em>prgchDst</em> is a pointer to a buffer provided for the
output string. It is filled as needed by the change engine, up to
cchDst.</p>

<p><em>cchDst</em> is the maximum number of wide characters
available in the output buffer (prgchDst).</p>

<p><em>pccaw</em> is used to trap processing errors. This can be
NULL if extended error information is not needed. If this is not
NULL and there is an error while converting the input text, the
ICsCallbackAToW::ProcessError method is called with information
about the error. If this is NULL, the error will be ignored, the
character will be transferred directly to the output buffer, and
processing will continue at the next character. Currently the
only kind of processing error that can be trapped is a missing
rule.</p>

<p><em>pcchNeed</em> is the number of wide characters returned in
prgchDst. This cannot be NULL.</p>

<p>If prgchDst is NULL and cchDst is 0, pcchNeed will contain the
size (in characters) needed for the output buffer.</p>

<p>If there is not enough room in prgchDst to store the entire
processed string, a failure code will be returned and the
contents of prgchDst and pcchNeed should be ignored.</p>

<p><strong>HRESULT ConvertCallback([in] CHAR * prgchSrc, [in] int
cchSrc, [in] int cchChunk, [in] ICsCallbackAToW * pccaw)</strong></p>

<p>ConvertCallback can be used in cases where a progress bar
might be desired to show the progress of processing a large
string. The ICsCallbackAToW::HaveText method will be called
repeatedly until the whole input string has been converted.</p>

<p><em>prgchSrc</em> is a buffer of CHARs containing the 8-bit
input string to change. This cannot be NULL.</p>

<p><em>cchSrc</em> is the number of characters in prgchSrc.</p>

<p><em>cchChunk</em> is the number of characters to return in
each callback message.</p>

<p><em>pccaw</em> is used to return the output of the conversion.
This cannot be NULL.</p>

<h3>ICsCallbackAToW interface</h3>

<p><strong>HRESULT HaveText([in] OLECHAR * prgch, [in] int cch, [in]
int cchCompleted)</strong></p>

<p>This callback method is called when a pointer to this
interface is passed to ICsConvertAToW::ConvertCallback.</p>

<p><em>prgch</em> contains the current 16-bit output string. If
this information needs to be stored somewhere, it must be copied
into a separate buffer, because once this method returns, the
buffer pointed to by prgch will no longer be valid.</p>

<p><em>cch</em> is the number of characters in prgch.</p>

<p><em>cchCompleted</em> is the total number of characters that
have been converted from the input buffer.</p>

<p><strong>HRESULT InitError([in] InitErrorCode iec, [in] int
iInvalidLine, [in] BSTR bstrInvalidLine, [out, retval] BOOL *
pfContinue);</strong></p>

<p>This callback method is called when an error occurs while
initializing a table.</p>

<p><em>iec</em> is the initialization error code.</p>

<p><em>iInvalidLine</em> is the index of the line where the error
occurred. If the bstrTable passed to Initialize was a filename,
this is the line index in that file. If the bstrTable passed to
Initialize was the actual table itself, this is the line index
within the table buffer.</p>

<p><em>bstrInvalidLine</em> contains the text of the line where
the error occurred.</p>

<p><em>pfContinue</em> is used to determine whether or not the
error is fatal. If this is set to TRUE, Initialize should
continue reading the table. If this is FALSE, Initialize should
stop.</p>

<p><strong>HRESULT ProcessError([in] int ichInput, [out, retval]
BOOL * pfContinue);</strong></p>

<p><em>ichInput</em> is the index of the character within the
input buffer where the processing error occurred.</p>

<p><em>pfContinue</em> is used to determine whether or not the
error is fatal. If this is set to TRUE, ConvertCallback or
ConvertRgch will continue reading the table. If this is FALSE,
ConvertCallback or ConvertRgch will stop.</p>

<p>Currently the only kind of processing error is a missing rule.
If this happens, ichInput will give the index of the character in
the input buffer which did not have a conversion rule specified
for it.</p>

<h2>ICsConvertWToA interface</h2>

<p><strong>HRESULT Initialize([in] BSTR bstrTable, [in] BOOL
fFileName, [in] ICsCallbackWToA * pccwa)</strong></p>

ICsConvertWToA is released.</p>

<p><em>bstrTable</em> is the path name for a file containing the
table, or the actual table, depending on fFileName. This cannot
be NULL.</p>

<p><em>fFileName</em> is true if bstrTable contains a file path
name and false if it contains the actual table text.</p>

<p><em>pccwa</em> is used to trap and respond to initialization
errors. This can be NULL if extended error information is not
needed. If this is not NULL and there is an error while
initializing the table, the ICsCallbackWToA::InitError method is
called with information about the error. If this is NULL and
there is an error while initializing the table, Initialize will
return a failure code.</p>

<p><strong>HRESULT Convert([in] BSTR bstrSrc, [out] CHAR **

using the compiled table. It is assumed that each string is in a
single encoding and is complete. In other words, context is not
maintained between calls to Convert and the associated table is
reinitialized for each string. A string could be an entire file

containing the changed text. This is a newly allocated 8-bit
string that the caller is responsible to free. This cannot be
NULL.</p>

<p><em>pcchNeed</em> will contain the number of characters in
pprgchDst. This cannot be NULL.</p>

about the error. If this is NULL, the error will be ignored, the
character will be transferred directly to the output buffer (causing
invalid output if the character is &gt; 0xFF), and processing
will continue at the next character. Currently the only kind of
processing error that can be trapped is a missing rule.</p>

<p><em>pcchNeed</em> is the number of characters returned in
prgchDst. This cannot be NULL.</p>

<p>If prgchDst is NULL and cchDst is 0, pcchNeed will contain the

<h2>CsConvertXToX table lookup engine</h2>

<p>CsConvertXToX classes are the simplest engine that implements
the ICsConvertXToX interfaces. They areoptimized for fast table
lookups. If more power is needed, then one of the other engines
is used instead of CsConvertXToX.</p>

<p>The internal table lookup engine reads a file, or takes an
input string that contains a table of changes. The input file
must be 16-bit. Each line contains one command</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>match &gt; replacement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where match is composed of one or more hex codes (i.e. 131E 6C)
separated by white space and replacement consists of zero or more
hex codes separated by white space. Case and leading zeros are
ignored when parsing hex codes. Code points between 10000 and 10ffff
are assumed to be Unicode surrogates and are translated into the
corresponding surrogate pair prior to matching or replacing.
Anything above 10ffff, or anything that can't be interpreted as a
hex number is considered an error. The order of lines in the
table is significant. Blank lines are ignored.</p>

<p>Comments may occur on any line. A comment begins with a hash
mark (#) and continues to the end of the line.</p>

<p>When the table is parsed during the Initialize method, it is
loaded into a trie for fast lookup. If an error is encountered,
the ICsCallbackXToX::InitError method is called to give extended
error information.</p>

<p>The Convert method works much like CC. It moves an input
pointer one character at a time. If a match is found at the
current input pointer, the replacement text is output and the
input pointer moves past the matched text. If a match is not
found, one character is output, the input pointer is moved to the
next character, and the lookup process is repeated. This process
means that replacement text is never processed again.</p>

<p>Here is a sample table.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p># My conversions<br>
	61 &gt; 61 # LATIN SMALL LETTER A<br>
	62 &gt; 65 # Change 1 to 1<br>
	87 &gt; 2021 # DOUBLE DAGGER<br>
	61 62 63 &gt; 3abc # Changes 3 characters to one character<br>
	89 &gt;&nbsp; # Deletes 89 from the input<br>
	63 64 65 &gt; 70 71 72 # Changes 3 characters to 3 different
	characters<br>
	3010 &gt; 30 40 # Changes 1 character to 2 characters<br>
	10001 &gt; 10401 # Changes one surrogate pair to another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This table would convert</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>60 61 62 63 61 3010 d800 dc01 3abc 62 63 64 65 66 89</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>60 61 65 63 61 30 40 d801 dc01 3abc 65 70 71 72 66</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Table Notes:</p>

<p>10001 represents the surrogate pair d800 dc01, and 10401
represents the surrogate pair d801 dc01, thus the last line is
equivalent to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d800 dc01 &gt; d801 dc01</p>

<p>The order of lines in the table is significant. As a result,
the fourth line is never matched because the first line always
processes the initial 61. In order for the fourth line to be
processed, it would need to precede the first line.</p>

<p>While the first line is a valid command, if the input and
output are the same, the line can be omitted unless it is there
to keep some later change from happening.</p>

<p>The following lines would be illegal in the table and would
cause an error when loading the table.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>10 # No replacement<br>
	20 &gt; 23 24 25 40 24<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 23 54 229&nbsp;
	# Replacements cannot continue to a new line<br>
	10 &gt; 2g3 # Illegal hex replacement<br>
	0x24 &gt; 22 # Illegal hex match (we are not supporting C
	notation)<br>
	'cat' &gt; 'dog' # Illegal hex codes in input and output<br>
	11ffff &gt; 2234 # Match hex code is too large<br>
	-10 &gt; 35 # Negative numbers not allowed<br>
	This is a comment line but is missing the beginning #<br>
	40 &gt; 34<br>
	40 &gt; 45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Duplicate input arguments not
	allowed</p>
</blockquote>
